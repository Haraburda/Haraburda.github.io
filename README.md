## Projects
1. [Commodity Consumption.](project/commodity_consumption.html)  The Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture tracks the supply of food available for consumption in the United States andexamines consumer food preferences by consumers’ age, income, region, race/ethnicity,and place where food is obtained, as well as by food/commodity categories and othercharacteristics. Descriptive statistics of this commodity consumption help inform producers about who consumes their commodities, how and where their commodities areconsumed, and how much is consumed. This data comes from four national food intake surveys conducted between 1994 and 2008. *(date: July 28, 2022)*
2. Forecasting Facility Codes for US Army Facilities. *(date: October, 2020)*
3. [COVID-19 Analyses within a DoD Organic Industrial Base](project/COVID.html). During the first week of March 2020, Indiana received its first confirmed COVID-19 case. Less than three weeks later, its Governor issued a ‘stay at home’ order. In response to this pandemic, Crane Army Ammunition Activity (CAAA), an organic industrial base located in Southern Indiana, activated its Crisis Management Team (CMT) and began implementing workforce protective measures such as social distancing and equipment/facility disinfecting, along with sending increased risk employees home on weather & safety leave or telework. Using R programming, I developed scripts to assess trends that supported decisions made by the CMT. These scripts included rolling averages and simple exponential smoothing forecasting. *(date: October 27, 2020)*

## Analysis Scripts (R programming)
<p align="center"><b>Chemical Engineering</b></p>
* [Liquid Density Predictions](chem_eng/ChE_predict_rho.html). To predict liquid densities using equations for the Rackett and Bhirud correlation methods. Examples include water and hexane, a polar and non-polar chemical respectively. *(date: June 9, 1994)*<br>
* [Vapor Pressures from Curve-Fitting](chem_eng/ChE_Curve_Fit_VP.html). To use simple and quick curve-fitting techniques to estimate vapor pressures using known data. This includes a quick estimate using the Antoine equation, and a more rigorous estimation using the Newton_Raphson method. *(date: July 13, 1994)*
<p></p>
<p></p><p align="center"><b>Machine Learning</b></p>
* [Classification and Regression Tree](machine_learning/ML_CART1.html). To structure a sequence of questions, the answers to which determine what the next question, if any should be.  The result of these questions is a tree-like structure where the ends are terminal nodes at which point there are no more questions. An example is provided with un-ordered data intermixed with continuous data, which applies the Classification and Regression Tree method to account for the different types of data in the analysis. *(data: February 4, 2019)*<br>
* [Machine Learning for an Imbalanced Dataset](machine_learning/ML_imbalanced_data.html). To use simple machine learning concepts involving an imbalanced dataset, one that contains skewed class proportions. An extreme example would be one with 99% of the data representing a majority class and 1% a minority one. Throwing this data into a machine learning algorithm might provide the wrong prediction when it completely ignores the minority class, predicting that all members of this dataset were majority members, demonstrated with a 99% overall accuracy. Methods to offset this imbalance includes sampling techniques and modeling evaluation techniques. In this example, I applied a balanced approach to maximize the average for each class, comparing it to the maximum accuracy for the overall dataset. *(date: January 17, 2019)*
<p></p>
* [Predictive Maintenance](machine_learning/ML_PdM1.html). To assess equipment failure data through the condition status of in-service equipment for estimating service life expectancy. This is a data-driven, proactive method for predictive maintenance (PdM) that relies upon sensors for early fault or fault detection. For this to work effectively, data from key sensors need to be available and accurately captured for analyses. *(date: December 15, 2022)*
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Modeling and Simulation</b></p>
* [Kriging to Predict Values on a Grid](modeling_simulation/Mod_Krige1.html). To predict values on a grid, portrayed graphically with contours, also known as Gaussian process regression. This method takes collected spatially related data, usually mapped to a grid coordinates, and estimates the values between the data. This is often used in soil science and geology. *(date: September 19, 2018)*<br>
* [Linear Programming](modeling_simulation/Mod_LinearProgram1.html). To use linear program techniques to calculate minimum or maximum values of a constrained objective function. Three examples are provided for Integer Programming (IP), Linear Programming (LP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) techniques. *(date: March 31, 2020)*
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Statistics</b></p>
* [Local Regression Smoothing of Data](statistics/Sta_Loess_Regression.html). To conduct local regression smoothing plots of data on x-y axis using LOESS (locally estimated scatter-plot smoothing). Different values for span are used to demonstrate this parameter for smoothing the curve that represents the scatter of data.  The default value is 0.75 So, the primary question becomes: <i>"What size span should I use?"</i> One method demonstrated is to use a visual interpretation using different span values and choosing the one with the least amount of smoothing that appears appropriate to the analysis. Other methods include calculations, such as cross validation (CV) and Generalized Cross Validation (GCV). A quick GCV approach is used to select the best span value in this example. *(date: February 4, 2019)*
<p></p>
* [Nonlinear Regression of Data](statistics/Sta_Nonlinear_Regression.html). To conduct non-linear regression plots of data along with cross-validation metrics to assess concerns regarding potential overfitting in the model. This example contains 101 data points. *(date: September 24, 2018)*
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Visualization</b></p>
* [Descriptive Analytics of Safety Data](visualization/Vis_Safety1.html). To portray a graphical representation of safety data using descriptive analytics to assess valuable information. This includes a Pareto by event for all safety incidents, a Pareto of recordable incidents, a graph of recordable incidents by unit and by day of the week, a heatmap of recordable safety incidents by day of the week for each unit (percentage by day and by unit), safety pyramid by severity for each unit, and heatmap of incidents by time of the weekday. *(date: October 15, 2019)*
<p></p>
* [Histogram Plot with Normal Distribution Curve](visualization/Vis_Histogram1.html). To portray a graphical representation of data using a histogram and a normal distribution curve (frequency weighted). *(date: September 20, 2018)*
<p></p>
* [Sankey Diagram](visualization/Vis_Sankey1.html). To portray a graphical representation of the flow of entities (ie money, material, and labor) between nodes, such as processes and organizations. This uses codes to generate Sankey diagrams, which are visualizations used to depict a flow from one set of values to another in which the things being connected are called nodes and the connections are called links. *(date: November 25, 2019)*
<p></p>
<p align="center"><b>Wrangle</b></p>
* [Replace Blank Cells with NA](wrangle/Wra_RemoveBlankCell.html).  To locate and remove blank cells (NULL) from data files with vectors characterized as factors and replace with NA. This also replaces factor types. *(date: September 18, 2018)*
<p></p>
* [Retrieve Tabular Data from a Website](wrangle/Wra_WebScrape1.html).  To retrieve tabular data via web scraping techniques. This example extracts the “past population” data (10th table on the website) from the Wikipedia “World Population” site. *(date: April 27, 2020)*
